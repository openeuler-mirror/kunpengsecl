# Kunpeng Security Libraries (kunpengsecl)

## Description

This project develops basic security software components running on Kunpeng processors. In the early stage, the project focuses on trusted computing fields such as remote attestation to empower security developers in the community.

## Software Architecture

![kunpengsecl arch](doc/RA-arch-1-en.png)

### Minimal realization

Users can write their own TEE Attester based on the TEE Verifier Lib and QCA Lib (released by Huawei) to verify the integrity of the user TA in the TEE, using the TEE self generated AK.

## Getting Started

### Installation based on openEuler system(??)

The openEuler system can use **RPM** method to install this program.
First, you can execute the following command to obtain the latest source code.

```shell
git clone https://gitee.com/openeuler/kunpengsecl.git
```

And then enter the *kunpengsecl/* directory and execute command `make rpm`, so that you can generate the RPM package of this program.

After completing the production of the rpm package, please enter the directory **rpmbuild/RPMS/x86_64(aarch64)** under the parent directory of kunpengsecl directory to install the rpm package you need.

```shell
$ rpm -ivh kunpengsecl-ras-2.0.0-1.x86_64(aarch64).rpm
```

If you no longer need this program in the future, you can also uninstall it using the following command.

```shell
$ rpm -e kunpengsecl-ras-2.0.0-1.x86_64(aarch64)
```

If you want to compile the source code, you need install some libraries as following:

```shell
$ sudo yum install openssl-devel crypto-devel cjson-devel cjson
```

### Installation based on Ubuntu system(Bionic Beaver 18.04.6 LTS)

The Ubuntu system does not support rpm installation, but we still provide you with a choice.

After cloning the project source code, for the installation of the server RAS and client RAC, enter the directory **kunpengsecl/attestation/ras** and **kunpengsecl/attestation/rac** respectively, execute the `make install` command to automatically compile the program and install the corresponding files to the default location.

In addition, it is also supported to execute `make install` in the kunpengsecl root directory while installing all programs.

If you need to customize the installation directory, you can use either of the following commands.

```shell
$ make DESTDIR=/xxx/xxx install
$ make install DESTDIR=/xxx/xxx
```

For the uninstallation of server RAS and client RAC, enter the **kunpengsecl/attestation/ras** and **kunpengsecl/attestation/rac** directories respectively and execute the `make uninstall` command to automatically clean up the installed files.

If you need to specify a file directory, you can choose either of the following uninstall instruction formats.

```shell
$ make DESTDIR=/xxx/xxx uninstall
$ make uninstall DESTDIR=/xxx/xxx
```

If you want to compile the source code, you need install some libraries as following:

```shell
$ sudo apt-get install build-essential openssl libssl-dev
```

If the libssl-dev couldn't be installed for the libssl version dismatched, you should reinstall libssl/libssl-dev through the deb packages as following:

```shell
$ wget https://mirror.umd.edu/ubuntu/ubuntu/pool/main/o/openssl/libssl1.1_1.1.1-1ubuntu2.1~18.04.23_amd64.deb
$ wget https://mirror.umd.edu/ubuntu/ubuntu/pool/main/o/openssl/libssl-dev_1.1.1-1ubuntu2.1~18.04.23_amd64.deb
$ sudo dpkg -i libssl1.1_1.1.1-1ubuntu2.1~18.04.23_amd64.deb
$ sudo dpkg -i libssl-dev_1.1.1-1ubuntu2.1~18.04.23_amd64.deb
```

You should install the third-party cjson library as following:

```shell
$ wget https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/cjson/1.7.15-1/+build/22291562/+files/libcjson1_1.7.15-1_amd64.deb
$ wget https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/cjson/1.7.15-1/+build/22291562/+files/libcjson-dev_1.7.15-1_amd64.deb
$ sudo dpkg -i libcjson1_1.7.15-1_amd64.deb
$ sudo dpkg -i libcjson-dev_1.7.15-1_amd64.deb
```

## Compilation

golang: >= 1.17.x

TA code: ARM GCC supported by ARM server

other C code: normal GCC in openEuler/Ubuntu distribution package

## Instruction for use

### Software configuration

To ensure the normal operation of the program, it is necessary to prepare the correct database environment. This requires you to first enter the **usr/share/attestation/ras** directory, and then execute the **prepare-database-env.sh** shell script to automate the database environment configuration.

By default, the configuration file on which the program runs has three paths: the current directory "./config.yaml", the HOME directory "${HOME}/.config/attestation/ras(rac)(rahub)(qcaserver)(attester)(tas)/config.yaml", and the system directory "/etc/attestation/ras(rac)(rahub)(qcaserver)(attester)(tas)/config.yaml".

In order to create the home directory configuration file, you can execute the script  **prepare-ras(rac)(hub)(qca)(attester)(tas)conf-env.sh** under **usr/share/attestation/ras(rac)(rahub)(qcaserver)(attractor)(tas)** after installing the RPM packages. This automatically completes the deployment of the home directory configuration file

### RAS startup parameters

Executing `ras` that you can start server. In the RAS directory, you need to provide a `ECDSA` public key and name it `ecdsakey.pub`.
The relevant parameters are as follows.

```text
  -H  --https         http/https switch，default is https(true), false=http
  -h  --hport         restful API port for RAS to listen in https mode
  -p, --port string   this app service listen at [IP]:PORT

```

### <a name="min-realization"></a>Minimal realization

#### QCA startup parameters

Enter `${DESTDIR}/usr/bin/qcaserver` on the command line to start the QCA program, please note that the full path of qcaserver must be used to start QTA normally, and the CA path parameter in QTA needs to be kept the same as the path.
The relevant parameters are as follows:

```text
  -C, --scenario int    set the application scenario of the program
  -S, --server string   specify an open server address/port
```

#### ATTESTER startup parameters

### Independent realization

#### No-DAA scenario

**Enable the server-side TAS for attestation keys**

Type `tas` on the command line to start TAS program.
The relevant parameters are as follows:

```text
  -T, --token         generate a verification code for testing and exit
```

**Enable QCA for the server**
ENTER `${DESTDIR}/usr/bin/qcaserver -C 1` at the command line to start QCA.

**Enable ATTESTER**

same as [Minimal realization](#min-realization)。

>notes: In a TAS environment, in order to improve the efficiency of QCA configuration certificate, not every boot needs to access the TAS to generate the corresponding certificate, but through the localized storage of the certificate, that is, read the certification path configured in `config.yaml` on the QCA side, check whether a TAS-issued certificate has been saved locally through the `func hasAKCert(s int) bool` function, and if the certificate is successfully read, TAS If the certificate cannot be read, you need to access the TAS and save the certificate returned by the TAS locally.

#### DAA scenario

**Enable the server-side TAS for attestation keys**

To enable the AKS service, you must configure the private key for AKS. Run the following command to modify the configuration file in the home directory:

```bash
$ cd ${HOME}/.config/attestation/tas
$ vim config.yaml
 # The values of the following DAA_GRP_KEY_SK_X and DAA_GRP_KEY_SK_Y are for testing purposes only.
 # Be sure to update their contents to ensure safety before normal use.
tasconfig:
  port: 127.0.0.1:40008
  rest: 127.0.0.1:40009
  akskeycertfile: ./ascert.crt
  aksprivkeyfile: ./aspriv.key
  huaweiitcafile: ./Huawei IT Product CA.pem
  DAA_GRP_KEY_SK_X: 65A9BF91AC8832379FF04DD2C6DEF16D48A56BE244F6E19274E97881A776543C
  DAA_GRP_KEY_SK_Y: 126F74258BB0CECA2AE7522C51825F980549EC1EF24F81D189D17E38F1773B56
```

Then enter `tas` to start TAS program.

**Enable QCA for the server**
The command line enters `${DESTDIR}/usr/bin/qcaserver -C 2` to start QCA.

**Enable ATTESTER**

same as [Minimal realization](#min-realization)。

>notes: In a TAS environment, in order to improve the efficiency of QCA configuration certificate, not every boot needs to access the TAS to generate the corresponding certificate, but through the localized storage of the certificate, that is, read the certification path configured in `config.yaml` on the QCA side, check whether a TAS-issued certificate has been saved locally through the `func hasAKCert(s int) bool` function. If the certificate is successfully read, there is no need to access TAS. If the certificate cannot be read, you need to access TAS and save the certificate returned by the TAS locally.

Currently, on the AKS side, the following interfaces are provided to support remote control by administrators:

```text
/config: GET
/config: POST
```

If the administrator needs to query the configuration information on the AKS side, you can use the GET method of the `/config` interface:

```shell
curl -X GET -H "Content-Type: application/json" http://localhost:40009/config
```

***
If the administrator needs to modify the configuration information of the AKS side, you can use the POST method of the `/config` interface:

```shell
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "Authorization: $AUTHTOKEN" -d '{"basevalue":"testvalue"}' http://localhost:40009/config
```

>notes: Currently, only the benchmark value is supported for reading and modifying configuration information on the AKS side

### Integrated realization

Users can verify the integrity of user TAs in TEE using the TEE/TA remote attestation capability integrated in the existing remote attestation framework of the security library.

### Interface definition

In order to facilitate the administrator to manage the target server, RAS and the user TA in the TEE deployed on the target server, this program designs the following interfaces for calling:

```text
/: GET
/{id}: GET、POST、DELETE
/{from}/{to}: GET
/{id}/reports: GET
/{id}/reports/{reportid}: GET、DELETE
/{id}/basevalues: GET
/{id}/newbasevalue: POST
/{id}/basevalues/{basevalueid}: GET、POST、DELETE
/{id}/ta/{tauuid}/status: GET
/{id}/ta/{tauuid}/tabasevalues: GET
/{id}/ta/{tauuid}/tabasevalues/{tabasevalueid}: GET、POST、DELETE
/{id}/ta/{tauuid}/newtabasevalue: POST
/{id}/ta/{tauuid}/tareports: GET
/{id}/ta/{tauuid}/tareports/{tareportid}: GET、DELETE
/version: GET
/login: GET
/config: GET、POST
/{id}/container/status: GET
/{id}/device/status: GET
```

Next, the specific usage of the above interfaces is introduced.
***
If you want to query information for all servers, you can use the `"/"` interface.

```shell
$ curl -X GET -H "Content-Type: application/json" http://localhost:40002/
```

***
If you want to query the details of the target server, you can use the `GET` method of the `"/{id}"` interface, where {id} is the unique identification number assigned by RAS to the target server.

```shell
$ curl -X GET -H "Content-Type: application/json" http://localhost:40002/1
```

***
If you want to modify the information of the target server, you can use the `POST` method of the `"/{id}"` interface, where $AUTHTOKEN is the authentication code that you automatically generated using `ras -T` beforehand.

```go
type clientInfo struct {
    Registered   *bool `json:"registered"`  // target server registration status
    IsAutoUpdate *bool `json:"isautoupdate"`// target server baseline update policy
}
```

```shell
$ curl -X POST -H "Authorization: $AUTHTOKEN" -H "Content-Type: application/json" http://localhost:40002/1 -d '{"registered":false, "isautoupdate":false}'
```

***
If you want to delete the target server, you can use the `DELETE` method of the `"/{id}"` interface, note that instead of deleting all information about the target server, you can set the registration status of the target server to `false`!

```shell
$ curl -X DELETE -H "Authorization: $AUTHTOKEN" -H "Content-Type: application/json" http://localhost:40002/1
```

***
If you want to query all server information in a specified range, you can use the `GET` method of the `"/{from}/{to}"` interface.

```shell
$ curl -X GET -H "Content-Type: application/json" http://localhost:40002/1/9
```

***
If you want to query all trusted reports of the target server, you can use the `GET` method of the `"/{id}/reports"` interface.

```shell
$ curl -X GET -H "Content-Type: application/json" http://localhost:40002/1/reports
```

***
If you want to query the details of a trusted report specified by the target server, you can use the `GET` method of the `"/{id}/reports/{reportid}"` interface, where {reportid} is the unique identification number assigned by RAS to the trusted report specified by the target server.

```shell
$ curl -X GET -H "Content-Type: application/json" http://localhost:40002/1/reports/1
```

***
If you want to delete the target server specified trusted report, you can use the `DELETE` method of the `"/{id}/reports/{reportid}"` interface, note that using this method will delete all information about the specified trusted report, and you will no longer be able to query the report through the interface!

```shell
$ curl -X DELETE -H "Authorization: $AUTHTOKEN" -H "Content-Type: application/json" http://localhost:40002/1/reports/1
```

***
If you want to query all baseline values of the target server, you can use the `GET` method of the `"/{id}/basevalues"` interface.

```shell
$ curl -X GET -H "Content-Type: application/json" http://localhost:40002/1/basevalues
```

***
If you want to add a baseline value to the target server, you can use the `POST` method of the `"/{id}/newbasevalue"` interface.

```go
type baseValueJson struct {
    BaseType   string `json:"basetype"`   // base value type
    Uuid       string `json:"uuid"`       // the identification number of the container or device
    Name       string `json:"name"`       // base value name

```

***
If you want to query the details of the base value specified by the target server, you can use the `GET` method of the `"/{id}/basevalues/{basevalueid}"` interface, where {basevalueid} is the unique identification number assigned by RAS to the specified base value of the target server.

```shell
$ curl -X GET -H "Content-Type: application/json" http://localhost:40002/1/basevalues/1
```

***
If you want to modify the available state of the target server's specified base value, you can use the `POST` method of the `"/{id}/basevalues/{basevalueid}"` interface.

```

***

If you want to query the trusted status of a specific user TA on the target server, you can use the GET method of the `"/{id}/ta/{tauuid}/status"` interface. where $AUTHTOKEN is the authentication code automatically generated by you using `ras -T` in advance, {id} is the unique identification number assigned by RAS to the target server, and {tauuid} is the identification number of the specific user TA.

```bash
$ curl -k -X GET -H "Content-type: application/json" -H "Authorization: $AUTHTOKEN" https://localhost:40003/{id}/ta/{tauuid}/status
```

***

## FAQ

1.Why do I get an error when RPM packing?

>Because the automatic compilation of the program will be completed before the actual rpm packaging, which depends on multiple package tools, if you have compilation errors, you can try to execute the **prepare-build-env.sh** script in the **kunpengsecl/attestation/quick-scripts** directory to prepare the necessary compilation environment.

```shell
$ bash ./attestation/quick-scripts/prepare-build-env.sh
```

2.Why is it inaccessible through RESTAPI after RAS is launched?

>Because RAS is started in HTTPS mode by default, you need to provide a valid certificate to RAS to access normally, while RAS started in HTTP mode does not need to provide a certificate.
